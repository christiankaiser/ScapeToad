# Welcome to ScapeToad


ScapeToad is an easy to use Java application for cartogram creation. A cartogram is a transformed map where the polygons are proportional to the value of a given statistical variable, e.g. the population. More information is available on the project web site at [scapetoad.choros.place](http://scapetoad.choros.place) or on the Github project site.


## Requirements

ScapeToad is an application which requires quite big computation resources. We have made quite an effort to make the cartogram making accessible. However, ScapeToad needs at least 512 MB of memory. If you want to produce high quality cartograms, it is preferable to have a fast processor. ScapeToad needs at least Java 1.4.
